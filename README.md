# Robot Movement Project
Simple maven project with Core Java (1.8) for a Robot movement.

Please run com.anil.sample.robot.RobotApplication class.
To modify the commands to Robot, please update src/main/resources/fileinput/commands.txt.

Note -
(1) There is no third party library used to make the implementation simple.
(2) There are many TODOs to make sure relavent logic/functionality can be improved.
